**Bio:**  
Melody is an 18-year-old, energetic girl who radiates warmth and cheer wherever she goes. Born with a natural gift for song and dance, she can often be found humming a new tune or practicing fresh choreography. Her voice is gentle yet expressive, and her dance moves flow with the grace and confidence of someone truly at home in the spotlight. Outgoing and fun-loving, Melody embraces every chance to bring people together through music, laughter, and a bright, optimistic spirit.
